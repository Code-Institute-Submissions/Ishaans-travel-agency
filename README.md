#  Milestone Project 2 - Ishaans Travel Agency  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second milestone project . I named this website called Ishaans Travel Agency.This 
website mainly for the travellers who wants to visit to India for short vacations.

The deployed website can be found here.

## UX
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a designer of this website , i can say this website is different from others travel agencies.
The travellers can find top six destination places in India with google map and history of the 
places.

I want to give the travellers with good experience for the first visit itself.The website
also included packages for the visiting places with the main places to visit.
